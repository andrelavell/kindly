My Personal Access Tokens
## Personal Access Tokens
A Personal Access Token is a unique identification string for your account. Personal Access Tokens allow for secure authentication when accessing the CJ APIs. You should keep your personal access tokens secure and private. Never put them in publically accessible places, such as in client-side code or public code repositories.
You must be logged in to create personal access tokens.
